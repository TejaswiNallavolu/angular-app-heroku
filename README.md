# Class-Reminder-App
We are planning to develop this app using technologies based on c# with DotNet and Angular as front-end.
As C# is brought up by Microsoft, it is most popularly used for the development of Windows desktop applications.
Angular is an open-source JavaScript framework most suited to develop this application.
